# Models Refactor — Change Log

Running log of changes made during the Models-folder refactor session, in order. Each section
covers one change: what changed, and for bigger changes, the background/theory/discussion that
led to the decision. Kept in the repo root per request so it survives independent of any single
chat session.

---

## 1. Naming convention: `HXI_` prefix

All new/renamed classes and files in this refactor use the `HXI_` prefix, replacing the older
`FFXIPH_`/`FFXIPackageHelper_` prefixes used throughout the rest of the codebase. This is a
deliberate standing decision (not limited to this refactor) — the rest of the codebase will be
renamed to match in a later, separate pass. `FFXIPH_ItemDescription` (in `FFXIPH_Item.php`) is
the one class intentionally left alone so far (see §9).

## 2. `sql_ASB` folder removed

Deleted entirely at request — it was a stale/deprecated duplicate of the `sql/` folder. `sql/` is
now the only trusted SQL schema reference. One consequence: the Character/EquipmentSet split
below was originally researched against `sql_ASB/dbequipsets.sql` (which defined `user_chars`/
`user_sets`); after the folder was deleted, that finding was re-verified directly against the live
query code in `FFXIPH_DatabaseQueryWrapper.php` instead, so it no longer depends on the deleted
folder.

## 3. Character / EquipmentSet split

**What changed:** `FFXIPH_Character` (deleted) is split into `HXI_Character` (userid, charid,
charname, race, merits, def) and a new `HXI_EquipmentSet` (usersetid, setname, mlvl, slvl, mjob,
sjob, equipment string).

**Background:** The old `FFXIPH_Character` mixed two separate DB rows into one class:
`user_chars` (one row per saved character) and `user_sets` (many rows per character — a character
can have multiple gear sets). Confirmed via the actual queries in `FFXIPH_DatabaseQueryWrapper.php`
(`getUserCharacters` selects `[charname, charid, race, merits, def]` from `user_chars`;
`getUserSetsFromUserID`/`fetchSet` select `[usersetid, mlvl, slvl, mjob, sjob, equipment, setname]`
from `user_sets`, one-to-many per user). This is why the old model couldn't represent "one
character, many sets."

**Discussion / preserved behavior:**
- `isDefault()` on the old class checked `race==0 && mlvl==0 && slvl==0 && mjob==0 && sjob==0`
  (used to detect "no query-string data at all" on a fresh page load). Split into
  `HXI_Character::isDefault()` (`race==0`) and `HXI_EquipmentSet::isDefault()` (mlvl/slvl/mjob/sjob
  all 0); call sites that need the old combined check now do
  `$character->isDefault() && $set->isDefault()`.
- `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipsets`'s constructor used to take one combined object and call
  `->toArray()` to build its internal `$sharedLink` flat array (read in ~15 places throughout that
  550-line file). Rather than rewrite all of those read sites, the constructor now takes
  `(HXI_Character $character, ?HXI_EquipmentSet $set = null)` and merges
  `array_merge($character->toArray(), $set->toArray())` into the same flat shape — a deliberate
  compatibility seam so a large, hard-to-test UI-generation file didn't need a blind rewrite.
- Verified against the client JS (`FFXIPackageHelper_DataManager.js`): the function that consumes
  a "character" API response (`updateCharacter`) only reads `charname/race/def/merits` — never
  `mjob/mlvl/equipment` from that response — so shrinking `HXI_Character::toURLsafeArray()` to
  character-only fields doesn't break the client.
- Merit encode/decode logic extracted into `HXI_MeritsCodec` (was inline in `FFXIPH_Character`).
- Found and fixed a real pre-existing bug while transcribing: the old
  `Character::setMerit($m, $value)` referenced undefined `$key`/`$value` variables instead of its
  own parameters, so it always wrote to the wrong array key. Fixed on `HXI_Character`.

## 4. `HXI_Race` enum

`FFXIPH_Races` (a plain static id→name array, effectively an enum) replaced with a real PHP 8.1
backed enum, `HXI_Race`. No SQL table backs race — it's a display-name lookup only.

## 5. Items: `HXI_Item`, `HXI_Weapon`, `HXI_Equipment`, `HXI_EquipSlot` (new)

**Background:** There was no real Item/Weapon/Equipment class in use anywhere before this. Actual
equipment was — and in most of the app, still is — untyped positional arrays, e.g.
`FFXIPackageHelper_Equipment` builds `[id, slot, rslot, mods, skilltype, name]` per slot, and other
code reads `$weapon[4]` by magic index for weapon-type checks.

**What was added:**
- `HXI_EquipSlot`: enum of the 16 gear slots (Main/Sub/Range/.../Feet), matching the existing
  grid ordering used throughout `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipsets`. Carries the `item_equipment.slot`
  bitmask value per slot (verified against `DatabaseQueryWrapper::getEquipment()`'s existing
  slot-bitmask switch statement).
- `HXI_Item`: base item (id, subId, name, sortName, type, stackSize, flags, auctionCategory,
  baseSell, level, iLevel, jobs, shieldSize, scriptType, slot/rslot/rslotlook, suLevel, mods) plus
  `longname`/`descr`/`races` (see §8).
- `HXI_Weapon extends HXI_Item`: adds skill/subskill/ilvlSkill/ilvlParry/ilvlMAcc/dmgType/hit/
  delay/dmg/unlockPoints, and real `isH2H()`/`is2Handed()` methods (weapon-skill-id based,
  matching the numbering already used elsewhere in this codebase).
- `HXI_Equipment`: the 16-slot loadout container (not a subtype of Item — a composition class per
  discussion with the requester, since "Equipment" means "a full 16-slot set," while weapons live
  in 4 of those slots alongside armor in the other 12).

`FFXIPH_ItemDescription` (old `FFXIPH_Item.php`) was left untouched per explicit instruction —
deferred to a future pass (see §9 for how it eventually connects to `dat_details`).

## 6. Mob / `HXI_MobStatCalculator` split

**What changed:** `FFXIPH_Mob` (566 lines) mixed plain data with heavy formula logic
(`importSQL`) and direct DB access (`new DatabaseQueryWrapper()` inside the model, in
`setModifiersFromSQL`). `FFXIPH_MobUtils` (also DB-coupled) had zero callers outside `FFXIPH_Mob`.

Both were absorbed: `HXI_Mob` is now pure data + accessors, `HXI_MobStatCalculator` owns the
formula logic and all the DB access, populating a `HXI_Mob` via its existing public setters.
`HXI_Mob::importSQL($SQLmob, $useLvl)` is kept as a one-line delegator to the calculator, so the
sole external call site (`FFXIPackageHelper_DataModel::buildMobStatsArray`) needed no changes
beyond the class rename.

## 7. `HXI_CharacterStatCalculator` (renamed from `FFXIPackageHelper_Stats`)

**Discussion:** The original plan (before this rename) was a shared `HXI_StatCalculator`
interface + `HXI_BaseStatCalculator` abstract class, with Mob and Character calculators as
concrete children. When asked to choose, the decision was: **mechanical rename only** for the
Character side (Option A) — no interface/base class. Given that, the same restraint was
deliberately extended to the Mob side too: an interface/abstract-base with only one real
implementer participating isn't worth building yet (premature abstraction with no second
consumer). Both calculators are standalone concrete classes for now; the shared contract is
explicitly deferred, not abandoned.

## 8. `sql/DAT_details.sql` + `DatabaseQueryWrapper::getFullItem()` + `HXI_ItemFactory`

**Background / theory:** Item data actually comes from two sources today. Mechanical stats (id,
slot/rslot bitmask, mods, weapon skill, level) come from the live DB (`item_basic`/
`item_equipment`/`item_weapon`/`item_mods`). Display text (name, description, valid races, and an
id-remap for custom server items ≥50000) comes from a separate ~75,000-line static PHP array,
`FFXIPackageHelper_ItemDetails`, generated once from the game client's DAT files (hence
`FFXIPH_ItemDescription`'s `importFromDAT()`/`DATid` naming — it was clearly designed to
eventually wrap this exact data).

`item_basic`/`item_equipment`/`item_weapon` are confirmed to be the private-server repo's own
schema, refreshed from upstream via separate update files (`dbupdate.sql`, `hxi_changes*.sql`) —
i.e. NOT owned by this project. This ruled out adding columns directly to those tables (anything
added would be wiped out on the next upstream refresh) — the new data needed its own table.

**Redundancy check before migrating anything:** cross-referenced each `ItemDetails` field against
existing DB columns/decoders before deciding what to actually migrate:
- `jobs` (array of job-name strings) — **fully redundant**. `item_equipment.jobs` is already a
  bitmask column, and this codebase already has a decoder for it
  (`ParserHelper::jobsFromInt()`/`checkJob()`). Not migrated.
- `lvl` — almost certainly the same data as `item_equipment.level`. Not migrated.
- `flags` — `item_basic.flags` already exists as a bitmask column; kept as-is at the requester's
  instruction (no spot-check needed, no migration).
- `name`, `longname`, `descr`, `races` — genuinely new, no DB equivalent exists. These (plus the
  ≥50000 custom-item replacement mapping) are what got migrated.

**Migration approach:** wrote a small Node.js script (no PHP available in this environment) to
parse the static PHP array text directly and emit `sql/DAT_details.sql`: a `dat_details` table
(itemid PK, name, longname, descr, races) with 7,526 real items. The 22 custom server items
(id ≥50000) were **pre-resolved and denormalized** at generation time — each gets its own row with
the borrowed item's display data already copied in — so no indirection/lookup logic is needed at
query time, unlike the old PHP `$replacement` array. Verified row count, spot-checked several
entries (including ones with embedded newlines and apostrophes) against the source array, and
confirmed no duplicate itemids before finalizing. Requires manual import — not applied to any live
DB from here.

**`DatabaseQueryWrapper::getFullItem($itemid)`** (new): one query joining all 5 tables
(`item_basic` + `item_equipment` + `item_weapon` + `item_mods` + `dat_details`), returning every
column needed to build a complete item — replacing the old pattern of a partial DB query plus a
separate `new FFXIPackageHelper_ItemDetails()` array-lookup.

**Overhead discussion:** `FFXIPackageHelper_ItemDetails` cannot cheaply look up one item — merely
instantiating it rebuilds the *entire* ~7,500-entry array in memory (PHP has no shared memory
between requests; OPcache only avoids re-parsing the source, not re-running the array-literal
construction), and this happens fresh on every request, sometimes multiple times per request
(`parseEquipment`, `updateGridItems`, `importlua_verify` each instantiate it separately). Joining
one more table on an indexed integer primary key is what a database is built to do efficiently, by
contrast. Conclusion: `getFullItem()` should be strictly cheaper, and the gap widens with how many
places in a request need item display data. (Not empirically benchmarked — no PHP/DB available in
this environment.)

**Bug fixed along the way:** `getItem()` aliased the weapon-skill column as `skilltype`, but
`getEquipment()` (the search path) aliased the same column as `skill`. `DataModel::parseEquipment()`
only ever reads `skilltype`, so every equipment SEARCH result silently got weapon-skill-type = 0
(single-item lookups were unaffected). Fixed by aliasing `getEquipment()`'s column as `skilltype`
too, matching `getItem()`.

## 9. `HXI_ItemFactory` + `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipment` wiring

`HXI_ItemFactory::fromFullItemRows($rows)` builds one `HXI_Item`/`HXI_Weapon` from a `getFullItem()`
result set (weapon vs. armor detected by whether `item_weapon` had a matching row via the LEFT
JOIN). `longname`/`descr`/`races` fields were added directly onto `HXI_Item` for this (safe, since
nothing depended on `HXI_Item`'s shape yet).

`FFXIPackageHelper_Equipment::queryItem()` now calls `getFullItem()` + the factory instead of the
old `getItem()` + `DataModel::parseEquipment()` + `ItemDetails`-array path. The real objects are
now the actual source of truth for equipping an item, stored per-slot
(`getItemObjects()`/`getWeaponInSlot()`).

**Deliberate compatibility seam:** `getEquipmentArray()` still returns the exact old
`[id, slot, rslot, mods, skilltype, name]` array (via a new `itemToLegacyModel()` converter), so
`HXI_CharacterStatCalculator` and the JS-facing grid needed zero changes for this step.
`isH2H()`/`is2Handed()` on `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipment` are untouched (still array-index based) —
this is intentionally staged (see the open item below): `HXI_CharacterStatCalculator` reads that
same legacy array in ~10 places, so retiring the array format is being done as its own separate,
reviewed step rather than in the same move as introducing the objects.

Out of scope for this step: the equipment **search** feature
(`FFXIPackageHelper_QueryController::queryEquipsetsSearchItems` / `APIModuleEquipmentSearch`) still
uses the old `getEquipment()` + `parseEquipment()` + `ItemDetails` path (it does benefit from the
skill/skilltype fix above, but hasn't been migrated to the factory).

## 10. `getEquipmentArray()` retired — everything migrated to `HXI_Item`/`HXI_Weapon` objects

The legacy `[id, slot, rslot, mods, skilltype, name]` array is gone. `getEquipmentArray()` and its
`itemToLegacyModel()` converter were deleted from `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipment`; `getItemObjects()`
(keyed 0-15, `?HXI_Item`) is now the only accessor, used everywhere a caller previously read the
array.

- `HXI_CharacterStatCalculator`: constructor's `$e` param is now the items array directly.
  `applyEquipment()` iterates items and calls `getMods()` instead of index `[3]`.
  `getATT()`/`getACC()`/`getWeaponSkillMerits()` resolve the main-hand weapon once
  (`$this->equipment[0] instanceof HXI_Weapon`) and call its own `->skill`/`->is2Handed()`/
  `->isH2H()` instead of `intval($this->equipment[0][4])` and the old static
  `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipment::is2Handed()`/`isH2H()` helpers.
- `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipment`: deleted the now-dead `$equipment` array property and the static
  `isH2H()`/`is2Handed()` methods (superseded by the object's own methods on `HXI_Weapon`).
- `APIModuleEquipsets.php` (3 call sites): `getEquipmentArray()` → `getItemObjects()`.
  `parseEquipmentLabels()` now reads `$item->name` instead of `$equipmentArray[$i][5]`.
- `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipsets.php`'s `showEquipsets()`: same swap.
- **Bug fixed along the way:** in the `equipsets_selectset` API action, `$newEquipmentArray` was
  referenced one line before it was actually assigned (a pre-existing bug — silently harmless
  before this change only because that positional constructor argument was unused downstream).
  Reordered so the assignment happens first.

Not migrated (deliberately out of scope): the equipment **search** feature still builds its own
separate array shape via the old `getEquipment()`/`parseEquipment()`/`ItemDetails` path — untouched.

## 11. Broader `FFXIPH_`/`FFXIPackageHelper_` → `HXI_` rename

Renamed the remaining 21 classes outside Models/ (Tabs/, helpers/, helpers/data/, Page Directs/) —
file + class name + extension.json + all call sites (~40 files touched). Scripted (Node.js,
word-boundary regex per class name) rather than done by hand given the size. `FFXIPH_ItemDescription`
still excluded (deferred, §9).

**Naming collision:** `FFXIPackageHelper_Equipment` (the old equipment-string-parsing helper) would
have collided with `HXI_Equipment` (the Models/ 16-slot container built earlier this session).
Renamed it to `HXI_EquipmentParser` instead — distinct from, and unrelated in role to, the domain
`HXI_Equipment` class.

Classes whose file names still carry the old prefix but whose class names never did (`ExclusionsHelper`,
`ParserHelper`, `DataModel`, `VanaTime`, `ZoneForecast`, `WeatherForecast_ElementMaps`) were left
alone — out of scope for a *class* rename.

## 12. Post-rename smoke test: search broke, then didn't

After importing `dat_details` and clearing the rename's cache lag, LSBSearch briefly returned no
results on all searches. Root cause: stale MediaWiki extension-registration/opcache after the
class rename — not a code bug. Confirmed fixed by a cache clear. Temporary `wfDebugLog('Other', ...)`
instrumentation was added across the equipment search path to localize it, then removed once
resolved. **Takeaway for next time:** clear MediaWiki's extension registration cache / reset
opcache immediately after any class rename, before concluding something broke.

## 13. Real enums for HXI_Variables' skill/mobType; HXI_ModDictionary for the mod ID lookup

`HXI_Variables.php` was a 1766-line grab-bag of legacy static lookup arrays (`$jobArrayByID`,
`$skill`, `$modArray` ~830 entries, `$effectType` ~640 entries, `$mobModArray`, etc.) — not real
PHP enums, just `public static $x = array(...)`. Asked whether to consolidate everything into that
file as "enums"; pushed back since the two real enums built earlier (`HXI_Race`, `HXI_EquipSlot`)
are a different construct (an actual `enum` declaration) than these array-based pseudo-enums, and
merging them in would break the one-symbol-per-file convention plus separate them from the domain
classes they belong next to.

Agreed instead to convert what's actually enum-shaped, and formalize the rest:
- `HXI_Skill` (new enum, `includes/Models/`): the 31 active combat/magic skill entries from
  `$skill` (commented-out/unused ids skipped). This array turned out to be dead — grepped and
  found zero live callers — so this is pure cleanup, zero call-site risk.
- `HXI_MobType` (new enum, `includes/Models/`): the 6 mob-type flags from `$mobType`. This one
  is a **bitmask**, not a discrete value — `FFXIPackageHelper_ParserHelper` checks
  `HXI_Variables::$mobType["NOTORIOUS"] & $mobType` (a raw mob's mobType can have multiple bits
  set). A plain enum still works fine for this: each case represents one named flag constant:
  the runtime combined value stays a plain int outside the enum, and the bitwise check becomes
  `HXI_MobType::Notorious->value & $mobType`. Updated all 3 call sites.
- `HXI_ModDictionary` (new class, `includes/helpers/data/`): `$modArray` (827 entries, item/mob
  modifier id -> name) extracted into its own class with `getName(int): string` (safe fallback
  `"UNKNOWN_MOD_" . $id` instead of an undefined-index warning) and `all(): array` (for the one
  caller that enumerates every mod name to zero-initialize a stat map). This is explicitly a
  runtime dictionary, not an enum — ids come from the DB and aren't a fixed closed set. Updated 4
  call sites across `HXI_CharacterStatCalculator`, `HXI_MobStatCalculator`, and
  `HXI_HTMLTableHelper`, removing the now-unnecessary `new HXI_Variables()` instantiations at each.

`$jobArrayByID`/`$jobArrayByName`/`$detectsBy`/`$effectStatus`/`$effectType`/`$mobModArray` were
left untouched in `HXI_Variables` — out of scope for this pass (not asked for), though
`$effectType` (~640 entries) and `$mobModArray` are similarly dictionary-shaped and could get the
same `HXI_ModDictionary` treatment later if wanted.

## 14. Equipment search migrated to the factory/objects

The equipment search feature (both the Equipsets modal slot-picker and the general LSBSearch
"Equipment Search" tab) was the last piece still on the old `getEquipment()`/`getEquipmentFromDB()`
+ `DataModel::parseEquipment()` + `HXI_ItemDetails`-array path — everything else already used
`HXI_Item`/`HXI_Weapon`. Migrated it:

- Widened `getEquipment()` and `getEquipmentFromDB()` in place (same WHERE-clause/filter behavior,
  untouched) to also join `item_weapon` and `dat_details` and select the full column set, matching
  `getFullItem()` — rather than duplicating them as parallel methods, since only the SELECT/JOIN
  needed to grow, not the search semantics.
- Added `HXI_ItemFactory::fromFullItemRowsGrouped($rows): array<int,HXI_Item>` — the single-item
  `fromFullItemRows()` was refactored to share a `buildFromGroup()` helper with this, which groups
  a bulk (interleaved, multi-item) row set by itemid before building one object per item. This is
  an improvement over the old `parseEquipment()`'s dedup logic, which grouped consecutive rows by
  matching *display name* rather than actual item id.
- `HXI_QueryController::queryEquipsetsSearchItems()` and `APIModuleEquipmentSearch::queryEquipment()`
  now build real `HXI_Item` objects and apply the job filter (`ParserHelper::checkJob`) themselves
  post-build, since they no longer go through `parseEquipment()`.
- `HXI_HTMLTableHelper::table_EquipmentQuery()` reads `$item->name/slot/jobs/level/descr` directly
  instead of the old associative-array shape; no longer needs `new HXI_ItemDetails()`.
- New `HXI_CustomItemIconMap` (the old `~22`-entry `$replacement` map, kept separately from
  `dat_details`): custom items (id ≥50000) have no client DAT art of their own, so their *icon*
  still needs to resolve to a real item's id even though `dat_details` already resolves their
  *display text* directly under their own id (baked in at generation time, see §8). Kept as a tiny
  dedicated class rather than adding a schema column, to avoid requiring another SQL re-import for
  22 rows.

**Now dead as a result:** `DataModel::parseEquipment()` has zero remaining callers anywhere in the
codebase. Left in place (it's a shared utility class with other still-used methods) rather than
deleted, since removing it wasn't explicitly asked for — flagging for a future cleanup pass.

---

## Open / deferred items

- `FFXIPH_ItemDescription` (`FFXIPH_Item.php`) — still fully untouched. Natural next step once
  revisited: fold into `HXI_Item`/the `dat_details` data path rather than staying separate.
- Migrate the equipment **search** feature to the new factory/objects too.
- `HXI_StatCalculator` interface / `HXI_BaseStatCalculator` abstract base — not built. Worth
  revisiting only once both Mob and Character calculators are ready to share real code.
- Filename-only cleanup for the classes noted in §11 (file still says `FFXIPackageHelper_X.php`/
  `FFXIPH_X.php` even though the class inside never had that prefix) — cosmetic, low priority.
- No PHP CLI or live MediaWiki/DB available in this environment at any point — nothing in this log
  has been executed/tested end-to-end. Manual smoke test still needed.
